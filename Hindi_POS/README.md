# Hindi Part of Speech (POS) Tagger

## Usage:

We support only UNIX based systems. There is nothing to do to install.

To tag the sample file given in this software, run this command

>     make tag

The sample file provided with the tool is [hindi.input.txt](https://bitbucket.org/sivareddyg/hindi-part-of-speech-tagger/src/master/hindi.input.txt). When you run the command, a file named `hindi.output` is created. For more tagging options, modify the Makefile.

For a sample output, see [hindi.sample.out.txt](https://bitbucket.org/sivareddyg/hindi-part-of-speech-tagger/src/master/hindi.sample.out.pdf).

## Output Format:

The output format contains the following columns separated by tab space.

| word | lemma |  **POS tag** | suffix | coarse pos | gender | number | case marker |
| :------: |:-----:| :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | 
| वर्षों |  वर्ष | **NN** | 0 | n | m | pl | 3 | o |

You probably require only the first 3 columns. The main pos tag is highlighted in bold.

## Tagset:

We use IIIT Tagset described in [posguidelines.pdf](https://bitbucket.org/sivareddyg/hindi-part-of-speech-tagger/src/master/posguidelines.pdf) (Bharati et al., 2006).

## Description

The tagger is similar to Model 5 described in Table 2 of (Reddy and Sharoff 2011), but with a focus on Hindi. Short synopsis is presented below. 

Large web corpora of Hindi is downloaded and cleaned, and tagged with with a high precision but low recall tagger. Morph analyzer is also run on this data. The tagger learns morphological analysis and pos tagging at the same time, there by pos tagging getting befitted from morphological analysis and vice versa. Since the tagger is trained on large data, the tagger is expected to handle large vocabulary, and also predicting the tags of unknown words using known words.

Current tagger is based on TnT tagger. TnT Tagger is well known for its robustness and speed, however it initially loads lex and trigram files which make take time to load. Once the loading is finished, we expect the tagger to be very fast.
